“Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes,
And Man is Mind, and evermore he takes
The tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills,
Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills:--
He thinks in secret, and it comes to pass:
Environment is but his looking-glass.”

> 心灵是塑造与创造的主宰力量，
人即心灵，他永远以思想为工具，
塑造他所愿之物，
带来千种欢乐，千种灾祸：--
他暗自思虑，而万物随之实现：
环境不过是他的镜子。

FOREWORD
This little volume (the result of meditation and experience) is not intended as an exhaustive treatise on the much-written-upon subject of the power of thought. It is suggestive rather than explanatory, its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and perception of the truth that--
"They themselves are makers of themselves."
by virtue of the thoughts, which they choose and encourage; that mind is the master-weaver, both of the inner garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in enlightenment and happiness.

> 前言
这本小册子（冥想与经验的结晶）并非旨在对人们早已广泛讨论的“思想之力”这一主题进行详尽论述。它更侧重于启发而非解释，其目的在于激发男女去发现并感知这样一个真理——
“他们自己就是自己命运的创造者。”
通过他们所选择并鼓励的思想；心灵是内在品格之衣与外在环境之衣的主宰织工，而他们过去或许曾在无知与痛苦中编织，如今却可以在觉悟与幸福中重新编织。

AS A MAN THINKETH
THOUGHT AND CHARACTER
The aphorism, "As a man thinketh in his heart so is he," not only embraces the whole of a man's being, but is so comprehensive as to reach out to every condition and circumstance of his life. A man is literally -what he thinks, -his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.
As the plant springs from, and could not be without, the seed, so every act of a man springs from the hidden seeds of thought, and could not have appeared without them. This applies equally to those acts called "spontaneous" and "unpremeditated" as to those, which are deliberately executed.
Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits; thus does a man garner in the sweet and bitter fruitage of his own husbandry.
"Thought in the mind hath made us, What we are
By thought was wrought and built. If a man's mind
Hath evil thoughts, pain comes on him as comes
The wheel the ox behind....
..If one endure
In purity of thought, joy follows him
As his own shadow--sure."
Man is a growth by law, and not a creation by artifice, and cause

> 人之思想
思想与性格
“人心所想，即其为人”这句格言，不仅涵盖了人的全部存在，而且其涵盖之广，足以触及人生中的一切境况与际遇。人实际上就是他所想的，他的性格正是其所有思想的总和。
正如植物由种子萌发，且无种子则无法生长，人的每一项行为皆源于思想深处的“种子”，没有这些种子，行为便无法显现。这同样适用于那些被称为“自发”或“未加思索”的行为，也适用于那些经过深思熟虑的行为。
行为是思想之花，而欢乐与痛苦则是其果实；因此，人便收获了自己耕耘所结出的甘甜与苦涩的果实。
“思想在心中塑造了我们，使我们成为今日之我；
思想铸就并建成了我们。若人心存恶念，
痛苦便如牛后之轮，随之而来……
若人能持守思想之纯净，
欢乐便如影随形，必然相伴。”
人乃循律而生之成长，而非人为之创造。

<!-- Paragraph 6 -->
and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of visible and material things. A noble and Godlike character is not a thing of favour or chance, but is the natural result of continued effort in right thinking, the effect of long-cherished association with Godlike thoughts. An ignoble and bestial character, by the same process, is the result of the continued harbouring of grovelling thoughts.
Man is made or unmade by himself; in the armoury of thought he forges the weapons by which he destroys himself; he also fashions the tools with which he builds for himself heavenly mansions of joy and strength and peace. By the right choice and true application of thought, man ascends to the Divine Perfection; by the abuse and wrong application of thought, he descends below the level of the beast. Between these two extremes are all the grades of character, and man is their maker and master.
Of all the beautiful truths pertaining to the soul which have been restored and brought to light in this age, none is more gladdening or fruitful of divine promise and confidence than this--that man is the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and shaper of condition, environment, and destiny.
As a being of Power, Intelligence, and Love, and the lord of his own thoughts, man holds the key to every situation, and contains within himself that transforming and regenerative agency by which he may make himself what he wills.
Man is always the master, even in his weaker and most abandoned state; but in his weakness and degradation he is the foolish master who misgoverns his "household." When he begins to reflect upon his condition, and to search diligently for the Law upon which his being is established, he then becomes the wise master, directing his energies with intelligence, and fashioning his thoughts to fruitful issues. Such is the ~conscious ~master, and man can only thus become

> 效果在思想的隐秘领域中与在可见物质世界中一样绝对且不可偏离。高尚而神性的品格并非偶然或幸运之物，而是正确思维持续努力的自然结果，是长久以来与神性思想相伴而生的产物。卑劣而野兽般的品格，同样通过这一过程，是持续怀有卑微思想的结果。
> 人是自己造就或毁灭自己的；在思想的兵工厂中，他锻造出摧毁自己的武器，也制造出为自己建造天堂般欢乐、力量与和平居所的工具。通过正确选择与真实运用思想，人可升至神圣的完美境界；通过滥用与错误运用思想，他则会堕落至低于野兽的水平。在这两个极端之间，是所有品格等级，而人正是它们的创造者与主宰者。
> 在这一时代被重新发现并照亮的所有关于灵魂的美丽真理中，没有比这更令人欢欣鼓舞、充满神圣应许与信心的了——人是思想的主宰，品格的塑造者，也是境遇、环境与命运的创造者与塑造者。
> 作为力量、智慧与爱的存在，作为自己思想的主人，人掌握着每种情境的钥匙，并在自身内蕴藏着一种转化与再生的力量，使他能够成为自己所愿之物。
> 人永远是主宰者，即使在他最软弱、最堕落的状态下亦然；但在软弱与堕落中，他成了愚昧的主宰，错误地管理着自己的“家宅”。当他开始反思自身处境，并孜孜不倦地探寻支撑其存在的法则时，他便成为睿智的主宰，以智慧引导自己的能量，并将思想塑造成富有成效的结果。这就是有意识的主宰者，而人唯有通过这种方式才能成为

<!-- Paragraph 7 -->
by discovering ~within himself~ the laws of thought; which discovery is totally a matter of application, self analysis, and experience.
Only by much searching and mining, are gold and diamonds obtained, and man can find every truth connected with his being, if he will dig deep into the mine of his soul; and that he is the maker of his character, the moulder of his life, and the builder of his destiny, he may unerringly prove, if he will watch, control, and alter his thoughts, tracing their effects upon himself, upon others, and upon his life and circumstances, linking cause and effect by patient practice and investigation, and utilizing his every experience, even to the most trivial, everyday occurrence, as a means of obtaining that knowledge of himself which is Understanding, Wisdom, Power. In this direction, as in no other, is the law absolute that "He that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened;" for only by patience, practice, and ceaseless importunity can a man enter the Door of the Temple of Knowledge.

> 通过在自身内发现思维的法则；这一发现完全取决于应用、自我分析和经验。
只有通过深入探索和挖掘，才能获得黄金和钻石，人若愿意深入挖掘自己灵魂的矿藏，便能发现与自身相关的每一真理；他可以确凿无疑地证明：他本人是性格的塑造者、生命的铸造者、命运的建筑师——只要他能观察、控制并调整自己的思想，追踪其对自己、他人、生活与境遇的影响，通过耐心的实践与探究，将因果关系联结起来，并将每一次经验，哪怕是再微不足道的日常事件，都作为获得“自我认知”的手段，从而获得真正的理解、智慧与力量。在这一方向上，没有任何其他领域能像这里一样，绝对地遵循“凡寻求者必得之；凡叩门者，门必为他而开”的法则；因为唯有通过耐心、实践与不懈的坚持，人才能进入知识圣殿的大门。

<!-- Paragraph 8 -->
EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON
CIRCUMSTANCES
Man’s mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently
cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or
neglected, it must, and will, ~bring forth.~ If no useful seeds are
~put ~into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will ~fall
~therein, and will continue to produce their kind.
Just as a gardener cultivates his plot, keeping it free from weeds,
and growing the flowers and fruits which he requires, so may a man
tend the garden of his mind, weeding out all the wrong, useless, and
impure thoughts, and cultivating toward perfection the flowers and
fruits of right, useful, and pure thoughts. By pursuing this
process, a man sooner or later discovers that he is the
master-gardener of his soul, the director of his life. He also
reveals, within himself, the laws of thought, and understands, with
ever-increasing accuracy, how the thought-forces and mind elements
operate in the shaping of his character, circumstances, and destiny.
Thought and character are one, and as character can only manifest
and discover itself through environment and circumstance, the outer
conditions of a person’s life will always be found to be
harmoniously related to his inner state. This does not mean that a
man’s circumstances at any given time are an indication of his
~entire ~character, but that those circumstances are so intimately
connected with some vital thought-element within himself that, for
the time being, they are indispensable to his development.
Every man is where he is by the law of his being; the thoughts which
he has built into his character have brought him there, and in the
arrangement of his life there is no element of chance, but all is

> 思想对境遇的影响

人的思想可以比作一座花园，它既可以被智慧地耕耘，也可以任其荒芜；但无论是否被耕耘或被忽视，它都必然、也必将“结出果实”。如果其中没有播下有用的种子，那么大量无用的杂草种子便会“落入”其中，并持续繁衍它们的种类。

正如园丁精心照料他的园圃，清除杂草，培育他所需要的花果一样，人也可以照料自己心灵的花园，清除所有错误、无用、不洁的思想，培育正直、有用、纯净思想的花朵与果实。通过遵循这一过程，人迟早会发现，自己是灵魂的总园丁，是生命之舵手。他也会在自身内揭示思想的法则，并日益精确地理解思想力量与心灵元素如何塑造他的性格、境遇与命运。

思想与性格是一体的，而性格唯有通过环境与境遇才能显现和展现自身，因此一个人生活的外在条件，总是与其内在状态和谐相关。这并不意味着一个人在某一时刻的境遇就能代表他“全部”的性格，而是说，这些境遇与他自身某个重要的思想元素紧密相连，因而在此时此刻，它们对他发展而言是不可或缺的。

每个人之所以处于他所在的位置，是因其“存在”的法则；他所构筑于性格中的思想，已将他带至此处，而他生命中的安排中没有任何偶然因素，一切皆是

<!-- Paragraph 9 -->
the result of a law which cannot err. This is just as true of those who feel "out of harmony" with their surroundings as of those who are contented with them.
As a progressive and evolving being, man is where he is that he may learn that he may grow; and as he learns the spiritual lesson which any circumstance contains for him, it passes away and gives place to other circumstances.
Man is buffeted by circumstances so long as he believes himself to be the creature of outside conditions, but when he realizes that he is a creative power, and that he may command the hidden soil and seeds of his being out of which circumstances grow, he then becomes the rightful master of himself.
That circumstances grow out of thought every man knows who has for any length of time practised self-control and self-purification, for he will have noticed that the alteration in his circumstances has been in exact ratio with his altered mental condition. So true is this that when a man earnestly applies himself to remedy the defects in his character, and makes swift and marked progress, he passes rapidly through a succession of vicissitudes.
The soul attracts that which it secretly harbours; that which it loves, and also that which it fears; it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations; it falls to the level of its unchastened desires,--and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own.
Every thought-seed sown or allowed to fall into the mind, and to take root there, produces its own, blossoming sooner or later into act, and bearing its own fruitage of opportunity and circumstance. Good thoughts bear good fruit, bad thoughts bad fruit.
The outer world of circumstance shapes itself to the inner world of

> 一项无法出错的法律的结果。这同样适用于那些感到“与环境格格不入”的人，也适用于那些对环境感到满意的人。
作为不断进步和演变的存在，人之所以处于某种境地，是为了学习、为了成长；当他领悟了任何境遇对他所蕴含的精神教训时，那境遇便会消逝，让位于其他境遇。
只要人认为自己是外部条件的产物，他就会被各种境遇所左右；但当他意识到自己是一种创造性的力量，并且能够支配自身内在潜藏的土壤与种子——这些种子正是境遇的来源——他便成为自己真正的主宰。
每一个人都知道，只要他长期实践自我控制与自我净化，就会发现：他的境遇变化与他内心状态的改变成正比。这一点如此真实，以至于当一个人诚心诚意地致力于改正性格缺陷，并迅速取得显著进步时，他便会迅速经历一系列起伏变化。
灵魂会吸引它内心深处所隐藏的一切：它所爱之物，也包括它所恐惧之物；它会达到自己珍视的期望之巅，也会跌落到自己未被净化的欲望之低谷——而境遇正是灵魂接收自身投射的媒介。
每一个播入或允许落入心灵、并在其中扎根的思想种子，都会产生其自身的结果，迟早会开花结果，转化为行动，并带来属于它自己的机遇与境遇。良善的思想结出良善的果实，邪恶的思想则结出邪恶的果实。
外在的境遇世界会根据内在世界而塑造自身。

<!-- Paragraph 10 -->
thought, and both pleasant and unpleasant external conditions are factors, which make for the ultimate good of the individual. As the reaper of his own harvest, man learns both by suffering and bliss.
Following the inmost desires, aspirations, thoughts, by which he allows himself to be dominated, (pursuing the will-o'-the-wisps of impure imaginings or steadfastly walking the highway of strong and high endeavour), a man at last arrives at their fruition and fulfilment in the outer conditions of his life. The laws of growth and adjustment everywhere obtains.
A man does not come to the alms-house or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of grovelling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. No such conditions can exist as descending into vice and its attendant sufferings apart from vicious inclinations, or ascending into virtue and its pure happiness without the continued cultivation of virtuous aspirations; and man, therefore, as the lord and master of thought, is the maker of himself the shaper and author of environment. Even at birth the soul comes to its own and through every step of its earthly pilgrimage it attracts those combinations of conditions which reveal itself, which are the reflections of its own purity and, impurity, its strength and weakness.
Men do not attract that which they ~want,~ but that which they ~are.~ Their whims, fancies, and ambitions are thwarted at every step, but their inmost thoughts and desires are fed with their own food, be it foul or clean. The "divinity that shapes our ends" is in ourselves; it is our very self. Only himself manacles man: thought and action are the gaolers of Fate--they imprison, being base; they are also the angels of Freedom--they liberate, being noble. Not what he

> 思想，而无论是令人愉悦还是不悦的外部条件，都是促成个体最终福祉的因素。作为自己收获的收割者，人通过痛苦与幸福两者皆有所学习。
追随内心深处的欲望、志向、思想，任其支配自己（追逐不洁幻想的虚幻之光，或坚定地走在崇高而坚毅的道路上），人最终在生活外在条件中实现其愿望与满足。万物皆遵循生长与适应的法则。
人并非因命运或环境的暴虐而步入乞丐院或监狱，而是因卑劣的思想与低劣的欲望而步入此道。纯洁心灵之人亦不会因任何单纯外力的压迫而突然堕入罪恶；犯罪的思想早已在内心秘密滋长，而时机一到，便显露其积蓄的力量。环境并非造就人，而是使人自我显现。绝无可能在没有邪恶倾向的情况下堕入罪恶及其伴随的苦难，或在没有持续培养美德志向的情况下升入美德及其纯粹的幸福；因此，人作为思想的主宰与主人，是自己命运的创造者，环境的塑造者与作者。即使在出生之时，灵魂便已回归自身，且在尘世旅程的每一步中，它皆吸引那些能显现其本质的条件组合，这些条件是其自身纯洁或污浊、强弱的映照。
人并非吸引自己所“想要”的事物，而是吸引自己所“是”的事物。他们的任性、幻想与野心在每一步中皆受挫，但其内心最深的思想与欲望却以自身为食粮，无论其污秽或洁净。塑造我们命运的“神明”就在我们自身之内；它就是我们自己。唯有自己束缚了人：思想与行动是命运的囚徒——它们因卑劣而囚禁人；它们亦是自由的天使——因崇高而解放人。并非他……

<!-- Paragraph 11 -->
wishes and prays for does a man get, but what he justly earns. His wishes and prayers are only gratified and answered when they harmonize with his thoughts and actions.
In the light of this truth, what, then, is the meaning of "fighting against circumstances?" It means that a man is continually revolting against an -effect- without, while all the time he is nourishing and preserving its -cause- in his heart. That cause may take the form of a conscious vice or an unconscious weakness; but whatever it is, it stubbornly retards the efforts of its possessor, and thus calls aloud for remedy.
Men are anxious to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves; they therefore remain bound. The man who does not shrink from self-crucifixion can never fail to accomplish the object upon which his heart is set. This is as true of earthly as of heavenly things. Even the man whose sole object is to acquire wealth must be prepared to make great personal sacrifices before he can accomplish his object; and how much more so he who would realize a strong and well-poised life?
Here is a man who is wretchedly poor. He is extremely anxious that his surroundings and home comforts should be improved, yet all the time he shirks his work, and considers he is justified in trying to deceive his employer on the ground of the insufficiency of his wages. Such a man does not understand the simplest rudiments of those principles which are the basis of true prosperity, and is not only totally unfitted to rise out of his wretchedness, but is actually attracting to himself a still deeper wretchedness by dwelling in, and acting out, indolent, deceptive, and unmanly thoughts.
Here is a rich man who is the victim of a painful and persistent disease as the result of gluttony. He is willing to give large sums of money to get rid of it, but he will not sacrifice his gluttonous

> 一个人所希望并祈祷得到的，不过是他应得的。他的愿望和祈祷只有在与他的思想和行为相一致时，才会得到满足和回应。
基于这一真理，那么“与环境抗争”又意味着什么呢？它意味着一个人不断反抗着外部的后果，却始终在内心滋养并维护着导致这一后果的原因。这种原因可能表现为一种有意识的恶习或一种无意识的弱点；但无论它是什么，它都会顽固地阻碍其拥有者的努力，从而迫切地呼唤补救。
人们渴望改善自己的处境，却不愿改善自己；因此他们始终被困住。那个不惧自我牺牲的人，绝不会失败于他心中所追求的目标。这在尘世和天上的事上同样真实。即使那个唯一目标是获取财富的人，也必须准备好做出巨大的个人牺牲，才能实现他的目标；而那些希望实现坚强而平衡生活的人，又何止于此呢？
这里有一个可怜的穷人。他极度渴望改善自己的环境和居家舒适度，却始终逃避工作，并认为自己有理由欺骗雇主，因为他的工资不足。这样的人根本不懂那些构成真正繁荣基础的最简单原则，他不仅完全不适合摆脱自己的不幸，反而因沉溺并实践懒惰、欺骗和懦弱的思想，而招致更深的不幸。
这里有一个富人，因暴食而遭受痛苦且顽固的疾病折磨。他愿意花费巨款来摆脱这种疾病，却不愿牺牲自己的暴食习性。

desires. He wants to gratify his taste for rich and unnatural viands
and have his health as well. Such a man is totally unfit to have
health, because he has not yet learned the first principles of a
healthy life.
Here is an employer of labour who adopts crooked measures to avoid
paying the regulation wage, and, in the hope of making larger
profits, reduces the wages of his workpeople. Such a man is
altogether unfitted for prosperity, and when he finds himself
bankrupt, both as regards reputation and riches, he blames
circumstances, not knowing that he is the sole author of his
condition.
I have introduced these three cases merely as illustrative of the
truth that man is the causer (though nearly always is unconsciously)
of his circumstances, and that, whilst aiming at a good end, he is
continually frustrating its accomplishment by encouraging thoughts
and desires which cannot possibly harmonize with that end. Such
cases could be multiplied and varied almost indefinitely, but this
is not necessary, as the reader can, if he so resolves, trace the
action of the laws of thought in his own mind and life, and until
this is done, mere external facts cannot serve as a ground of
reasoning.
Circumstances, however, are so complicated, thought is so deeply
rooted, and the conditions of happiness vary so, vastly with
individuals, that a man's entire soul-condition (although it may be
known to himself) cannot be judged by another from the external
aspect of his life alone. A man may be honest in certain directions,
yet suffer privations; a man may be dishonest in certain directions,
yet acquire wealth; but the conclusion usually formed that the one
man fails -because of his particular honesty, -and that the other
-prosperers because of his particular dishonesty, -is the result of a
superficial judgment, which assumes that the dishonest man is almost
totally corrupt, and the honest man almost entirely virtuous. In the

这里有一个雇佣劳动的人，他采取不正当手段以逃避支付法定工资，并希望借此获得更大的利润，从而降低工人的工资。这样的人完全不适合获得繁荣，当他发现自己破产时——无论是名誉还是财富——他便责怪环境，却不知自己才是自己处境的唯一创造者。
我仅举出这三个例子，是为了说明一个真理：人是自己处境的制造者（尽管常常是无意识的），而当他追求良好结果时，却因鼓励那些根本无法与该目标相协调的思想和欲望，不断阻碍其实现。这样的例子可以几乎无限地加以增补和变化，但这并非必要，因为读者若愿意，可以自行在自己的思想和生活中观察思维法则的作用；在这一点完成之前，仅仅依靠外部事实无法作为推理的基础。
然而，环境如此复杂，思想根深蒂固，而幸福的条件因人而异，变化极大，以至于一个人的整个精神状态（尽管他可能自己知道）不能仅凭其生活外在表现，由他人加以判断。一个人在某些方面可能诚实，却遭受匮乏；另一个人在某些方面可能不诚实，却获得财富；但通常人们得出的结论——前者因他的特定诚实而失败，后者因他的特定不诚实而成功——是肤浅的判断，它假定不诚实者几乎完全腐败，而诚实者几乎完全高尚。在

light of a deeper knowledge and wider experience such judgment is found to be erroneous. The dishonest man may have some admirable virtues, which the other does, not possess; and the honest man obnoxious vices which are absent in the other. The honest man reaps the good results of his honest thoughts and acts; he also brings upon himself the sufferings, which his vices produce. The dishonest man likewise garners his own suffering and happiness.
It is pleasing to human vanity to believe that one suffers because of one's virtue; but not until a man has extirpated every sickly, bitter, and impure thought from his mind, and washed every sinful stain from his soul, can he be in a position to know and declare that his sufferings are the result of his good, and not of his bad qualities; and on the way to, yet long before he has reached, that supreme perfection, he will have found, working in his mind and life, the Great Law which is absolutely just, and which cannot, therefore, give good for evil, evil for good. Possessed of such knowledge, he will then know, looking back upon his past ignorance and blindness, that his life is, and always was, justly ordered, and that all his past experiences, good and bad, were the equitable outworking of his evolving, yet unevolved self.
Good thoughts and actions can never produce bad results; bad thoughts and actions can never produce good results. This is but saying that nothing can come from corn but corn, nothing from nettles but nettles. Men understand this law in the natural world, and work with it; but few understand it in the mental and moral world (though its operation there is just as simple and undeviating), and they, therefore, do not co-operate with it.
Suffering is -always- the effect of wrong thought in some direction. It is an indication that the individual is out of harmony with himself, with the Law of his being. The sole and supreme use of suffering is to purify, to burn out all that is useless and impure. Suffering ceases for him who is pure. There could be no object in

> 当以更深的知识和更广的经验为依据时，这种判断被发现是错误的。不诚实的人可能具有一些诚实的人所不具备的可敬美德；而诚实的人则可能具有一些不诚实的人所没有的可憎恶的缺点。诚实的人因其诚实的思想和行为而获得善果；他也因自己的缺点而招致痛苦。不诚实的人同样会收获自己的痛苦与幸福。
> 人们出于虚荣，乐于相信自己所遭受的痛苦是由于自己的美德所致；但只有当一个人彻底清除心中所有病态、苦涩和不洁的思想，并洗净灵魂中一切罪恶的污点时，他才能真正知晓并宣称：他的痛苦源于他的善行，而非恶行；在尚未达到至高完美境界之前，他已在自己的思想与生活中发现那绝对公正的“大法”，此法绝不可能以恶报善、以善报恶。一旦拥有这样的知识，他回顾自己过去的无知与盲目时，便会明白：他的生命，始终是公正有序的，而他过去的一切经历——无论是好是坏——都是他正在演化却尚未完全演化之自我所必然产生的公平结果。
> 善念与善行绝不会产生恶果；恶念与恶行也绝不会产生善果。这不过是说：从谷物中不可能长出杂草，从荨麻中不可能长出甜美的果实。人们在自然世界中理解并运用这一法则；但在精神与道德世界中，却很少有人理解（尽管其运作方式同样简单而绝对不变），因此他们并不与之合作。
> 痛苦总是某种方向错误思想的后果。它表明个体与自我、与自身存在的法则不和谐。痛苦唯一的、至高无上的作用，就是净化，烧尽一切无用与不洁之物。对于纯净者而言，痛苦将不复存在。若没有这一目的，

burning gold after the dross had been removed, and a perfectly pure
and enlightened being could not suffer.
The circumstances, which a man encounters with suffering, are the
result of his own mental in harmony. The circumstances, which a man
encounters with blessedness, are the result of his own mental
harmony. Blessedness, not material possessions, is the measure of
right thought; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is
the measure of wrong thought. A man may be cursed and rich; he may
be blessed and poor. Blessedness and riches are only joined together
when the riches are rightly and wisely used; and the poor man only
descends into wretchedness when he regards his lot as a burden
unjustly imposed.
Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness. They
are both equally unnatural and the result of mental disorder. A man
is not rightly conditioned until he is a happy, healthy, and
prosperous being; and happiness, health, and prosperity are the
result of a harmonious adjustment of the inner with the outer, of
the man with his surroundings.
A man only begins to be a man when he ceases to whine and revile,
and commences to search for the hidden justice which regulates his
life. And as he adapts his mind to that regulating factor, he ceases
to accuse others as the cause of his condition, and builds himself
up in strong and noble thoughts; ceases to kick against
circumstances, but begins to ~use~ them as aids to his more rapid
progress, and as a means of discovering the hidden powers and
possibilities within himself.
Law, not confusion, is the dominating principle in the universe;
justice, not injustice, is the soul and substance of life; and
righteousness, not corruption, is the moulding and moving force in
the spiritual government of the world. This being so, man has but to
right himself to find that the universe is right; and during the

一个人遭遇苦难的境遇，是其自身内心不和谐所致；而一个人遭遇福乐的境遇，是其自身内心和谐所致。福乐，而非物质财富，是正确思想的衡量标准；困苦，而非缺乏物质财富，是错误思想的衡量标准。一个人可能受诅咒却富有；也可能蒙福却贫穷。福乐与财富仅在财富被正确而明智地使用时才结合在一起；而穷人只有在将自身境遇视为不公正强加于己的负担时，才会陷入困苦。
贫穷与放纵是两种极端的困苦状态。它们同样都是非自然的，是心理失衡的结果。一个人只有在成为幸福、健康且富足的众生时，才真正处于正确的状态；而幸福、健康与富足，是内心与外在、人与其环境和谐调整的结果。
一个人只有在停止抱怨与咒骂，开始探寻支配其生命的隐秘正义时，才真正成为一个人。当他将自己的心灵调整以适应这一支配因素时，他便不再将他人视为自己处境的原因，而是以坚强而崇高的思想塑造自己；不再抗拒环境，而是开始利用环境作为自己更快进步的助力，作为发现自身内在隐藏力量与可能性的途径。

process of putting himself right he will find that as he alters his thoughts towards things and other people, things and other people will alter towards him.
The proof of this truth is in every person, and it therefore admits of easy investigation by systematic introspection and self-analysis. Let a man radically alter his thoughts, and he will be astonished at the rapid transformation it will effect in the material conditions of his life. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies into circumstance. Bestial thoughts crystallize into habits of drunkenness and sensuality, which solidify into circumstances of destitution and disease: impure thoughts of every kind crystallize into enervating and confusing habits, which solidify into distracting and adverse circumstances: thoughts of fear, doubt, and indecision crystallize into weak, unmanly, and irresolute habits, which solidify into circumstances of failure, indigence, and slavish dependence: lazy thoughts crystallize into habits of uncleanliness and dishonesty, which solidify into circumstances of foulness and beggary: hateful and condemnatory thoughts crystallize into habits of accusation and violence, which solidify into circumstances of injury and persecution: selfish thoughts of all kinds crystallize into habits of self-seeking, which solidify into circumstances more or less distressing. On the other hand, beautiful thoughts of all kinds crystallize into habits of grace and kindliness, which solidify into genial and sunny circumstances: pure thoughts crystallize into habits of temperance and self-control, which solidify into circumstances of repose and peace: thoughts of courage, self-reliance, and decision crystallize into manly habits, which solidify into circumstances of success, plenty, and freedom: energetic thoughts crystallize into habits of cleanliness and industry, which solidify into circumstances of pleasantness: gentle and forgiving thoughts crystallize into habits of gentleness, which solidify into protective and preservative circumstances: loving and unselfish thoughts crystallize into habits of self-forgetfulness for

这一真理的证明存在于每个人身上，因此通过系统的内省和自我分析，很容易加以探究。倘若一个人彻底改变自己的想法，他会惊讶于这将迅速改变他生活中的物质条件。人们以为思想可以保密，但实际上却不能；思想会迅速凝结成习惯，而习惯又固化成环境。粗鄙的思想凝结成酗酒和纵欲的习惯，进而固化成贫困与疾病的情境；各种不洁的思想凝结成削弱和混乱的习惯，进而固化成分散注意力和不利的情境；恐惧、怀疑和犹豫不决的思想凝结成软弱、无男子气概和优柔寡断的习惯，进而固化成失败、贫困和奴性依附的情境；懒惰的思想凝结成肮脏和不诚实的习惯，进而固化成污秽与乞讨的情境；憎恨和谴责的思想凝结成指责和暴力的习惯，进而固化成伤害与迫害的情境；各种自私的思想凝结成自我中心的习惯，进而固化成或多或少令人痛苦的情境。另一方面，各种美好的思想凝结成优雅和友善的习惯，进而固化成愉悦和阳光的情境；纯洁的思想凝结成节制和自律的习惯，进而固化成宁静与和平的情境；勇气、自立和决断的思想凝结成男子气概的习惯，进而固化成成功、丰裕与自由的情境；充满活力的思想凝结成清洁和勤奋的习惯，进而固化成令人愉快的情境；温和与宽恕的思想凝结成温柔的习惯，进而固化成保护与守卫的情境；爱与无私的思想凝结成自我忘却的习

EFFECT OF THOUGHT ON
HEALTH AND THE BODY
The body is the servant of the mind. It obeys the operations of the
mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically
expressed. At the bidding of unlawful thoughts the body sinks
rapidly into disease and decay; at the command of glad and beautiful
thoughts it becomes clothed with youthfulness and beauty.
Disease and health, like circumstances, are rooted in thought.
Sickly thoughts will express themselves through a sickly body.
Thoughts of fear have been known to kill a man as speedily as a
bullet, and they are continually killing thousands of people just as
surely though less rapidly. The people who live in fear of disease
are the people who get it. Anxiety quickly demoralizes the whole
body, and lays it open to the, entrance of disease; while impure
thoughts, even if not physically indulged, will soon shatter the
nervous system.
Strong, pure, and happy thoughts build up the body in vigour and
grace. The body is a delicate and plastic instrument, which responds
readily to the thoughts by which it is impressed, and habits of
thought will produce their own effects, good or bad, upon it.
Men will continue to have impure and poisoned blood, so long as they
propagate unclean thoughts. Out of a clean heart comes a clean life
and a clean body. Out of a defiled mind proceeds a defiled life and
a corrupt body. Thought is the fount of action, life, and
manifestation; make the fountain pure, and all will be pure.
Change of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts.

> 思想对健康与身体的影响

身体是心灵的仆人。它服从心灵的运作，无论是有意选择的，还是自动表达的。当不正当的思想发出指令时，身体会迅速陷入疾病与衰败；而当喜悦美好的思想发出命令时，身体则会焕发青春与美丽。

疾病与健康，如同环境一样，根植于思想之中。病态的思想会通过病态的身体表现出来。恐惧的思想曾被证实能像子弹一样迅速致人死亡，而它们正持续不断地以更缓慢但同样确凿的方式杀死成千上万的人。那些生活在对疾病恐惧中的人，正是会患上疾病的人。焦虑会迅速摧毁整个身体，使其易于疾病侵入；而即使未在肉体上放纵，不洁的思想也会很快摧毁神经系统。

强烈、纯净、快乐的思想会赋予身体活力与优雅。身体是一种敏感而可塑的工具，它极易响应影响它的思想，而思想的习惯将产生自身的好或坏的效果。

只要人们继续传播不洁的思想，他们就会继续拥有不洁与被毒害的血液。从一颗洁净的心灵中，将诞生洁净的生活与洁净的身体；从被玷污的心灵中，将产生被玷污的生活与腐败的身体。思想是行动、生命与表现的源泉；净化源头，一切都会纯净。

改变饮食，对那些不愿改变思想的人来说，不会有所帮助。

<!-- Paragraph 19 -->
When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.
Clean thoughts make clean habits. The so-called saint who does not wash his body is not a saint. He who has strengthened and purified his thoughts does not need to consider the malevolent microbe.
If you would protect your body, guard your mind. If you would renew your body, beautify your mind. Thoughts of malice, envy, disappointment, despondency, rob the body of its health and grace. A sour face does not come by chance; it is made by sour thoughts. Wrinkles that mar are drawn by folly, passion, and pride.
I know a woman of ninety-six who has the bright, innocent face of a girl. I know a man well under middle age whose face is drawn into inharmonious contours. The one is the result of a sweet and sunny disposition; the other is the outcome of passion and discontent.
As you cannot have a sweet and wholesome abode unless you admit the air and sunshine freely into your rooms, so a strong body and a bright, happy, or serene countenance can only result from the free admittance into the mind of thoughts of joy and goodwill and serenity.
On the faces of the aged there are wrinkles made by sympathy, others by strong and pure thought, and others are carved by passion: who cannot distinguish them? With those who have lived righteously, age is calm, peaceful, and softly mellowed, like the setting sun. I have recently seen a philosopher on his deathbed. He was not old except in years. He died as sweetly and peacefully as he had lived.
There is no physician like cheerful thought for dissipating the ills of the body; there is no comforter to compare with goodwill for dispersing the shadows of grief and sorrow. To live continually in thoughts of ill will, cynicism, suspicion, and envy, is to be

> 当一个人使自己的思想纯净时，他便不再渴望不洁的食物。
纯净的思想造就纯净的习惯。所谓不洗澡的圣人，并非真正的圣人。那些思想已加强并净化的人，无需再顾虑有害的微生物。
若想保护身体，须守护心灵；若想更新身体，须美化心灵。恶意、嫉妒、失望、沮丧等念头，会剥夺身体的健康与优雅。愁眉苦脸并非偶然，而是由酸涩的思想所致。那些破坏容貌的皱纹，是由愚昧、激情与骄傲所刻下的。
我认识一位九十六岁的女性，她却拥有少女般明亮纯真的面容。我也认识一位中年男子，其面容却显得不和谐、扭曲。前者是甜美阳光性格的成果；后者则是激情与不满的产物。
正如你若想拥有甜美健康的居所，就必须让空气与阳光自由进入房间，同样，强健的身体与明亮、快乐或宁静的面容，只能源于快乐、善意与宁静的思想自由流入心灵。
老年人脸上的皱纹，有的由同情所刻，有的由强烈而纯净的思想所成，有的则由激情所雕琢：谁人不能分辨？那些正直生活的人，年老时面容平静、安宁，如夕阳般温柔醇厚。我最近见过一位哲学家临终时的情景。他虽年岁已高，却并非老态龙钟。他临终时，如生前一样，平静而甜美地离去。
没有任何医生能比快乐的思想更有效地消除身体的病痛；没有任何安慰者能比善意更有效地驱散悲伤与忧愁的阴影。若持续沉溺于恶意、愤世嫉俗、猜疑与嫉妒的思想中，便是

<!-- Paragraph 20 -->

<!-- Paragraph 21 -->
THOUGHT AND PURPOSE
Unti thought is linked with purpose there is no intelligent accomplishment. With the majority the bark of thought is allowed to "drift" upon the ocean of life. Aimlessness is a vice, and such drifting must not continue for him who would steer clear of catastrophe and destruction.
They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings, all of which are indications of weakness, which lead, just as surely as deliberately planned sins (though by a different route), to failure, unhappiness, and loss, for weakness cannot persist in a power evolving universe.
A man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his thought-forces upon the object, which he has set before him. He should make this purpose his supreme duty, and should devote himself to its attainment, not allowing his thoughts to wander away into ephemeral fancies, longings, and imaginings. This is the royal road to self-control and true concentration of thought. Even if he fails again and again to accomplish his purpose (as he necessarily must until weakness is overcome), the -strength of character gained- will be the measure of -his true- success, and this will form a new starting-point for future power and triumph.
Those who are not prepared for the apprehension of a -great- purpose should fix the thoughts upon the faultless performance of their duty, no matter how insignificant their task may appear. Only in

> 思想与目的  
若思想未与目的相连，则无智能之成就。对大多数人而言，思想之“波涛”被允许在生命之海洋中“漂浮”。无目标是一种恶习，而这种漂浮绝不可持续，对于那些欲避开灾难与毁灭之人而言。  
那些生命中缺乏中心目的者，极易沦为琐碎忧虑、恐惧、烦恼与自怜的俘虏，所有这些皆为软弱之征兆，正如刻意策划的罪孽（虽路径不同）一般，必然导致失败、不幸福与损失，因为软弱无法在力量不断演化的宇宙中持久存在。  
人应于心中构想一个正当的目的，并着手实现之。他应使此目的成为其思想之中心点。此目的或表现为精神理想，或为尘世目标，视其当下之本性而定；但无论何种目的，他都应持续将思想之力集中于其设定之目标上。他应视此目的为最高责任，并倾力追求之，不可让思想飘离至虚幻的幻想、渴望与想象之中。这是自我控制与思想真正集中的皇家大道。即使他屡次未能达成目的（直至软弱被克服前，此乃必然），其获得之性格力量，将衡量其真正的成功，而此将构成未来力量与胜利之新起点。  
对于尚未准备好承担伟大目的之人，应专注于无瑕履行其职责，无论其任务看似多么微不足道。唯有在

this way can the thoughts be gathered and focussed, and resolution
and energy be developed, which being done, there is nothing which
may not be accomplished.
The weakest soul, knowing its own weakness, and believing this truth
~that strength can only be developed by effort and practice,~ will,
thus believing, at once begin to exert itself, and, adding effort to
effort, patience to patience, and strength to strength, will never
cease to develop, and will at last grow divinely strong.
As the physically weak man can make himself strong by careful and
patient training, so the man of weak thoughts can make them strong
by exercising himself in right thinking.
To put away aimlessness and weakness, and to begin to think with
purpose, is to enter the ranks of those strong ones who only
recognize failure as one of the pathways to attainment; who make all
conditions serve them, and who think strongly, attempt fearlessly,
and accomplish masterfully.
Having conceived of his purpose, a man should mentally mark out a
~straight~ pathway to its achievement, looking neither to the right
nor the left. Doubts and fears should be rigorously excluded; they
are disintegrating elements, which break up the straight line of
effort, rendering it crooked, ineffectual, useless. Thoughts of
doubt and fear never accomplished anything, and never can. They
always lead to failure. Purpose, energy, power to do, and all strong
thoughts cease when doubt and fear creep in.
The will to do springs from the knowledge that we ~can~ do. Doubt
and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages
them, who does not slay them. thwarts himself at every step.

> 如此，思想便能被凝聚与集中，意志与能量亦随之发展，一旦做到这些，便没有什么不能实现。
最软弱的灵魂，若知晓自身的软弱，并相信这一真理——即力量唯有通过努力与实践才能发展——便会因这种信念，立即开始努力，并不断加诸努力于努力、耐心于耐心、力量于力量，永不停止发展，终将成长为神圣般强大的存在。
正如身体虚弱者可通过谨慎与耐心的训练使自己强壮，思想软弱者亦可通过正确思考的锻炼使思想变得坚强。
摒弃无目标与软弱，开始有目的思考，即是步入那些强者之列——他们只将失败视为通往成就之路之一；他们使所有条件服务于自己；他们思考坚定、行动无畏、成就卓越。
一旦确立目标，人便应在心中规划一条笔直的路径以达成之，不左顾右盼。疑虑与恐惧必须严格排除；它们是破坏性因素，会破坏努力的直线路径，使其弯曲、无效、无用。疑虑与恐惧之思从未成就任何事，也绝不会成就任何事。它们总是导致失败。一旦疑虑与恐惧侵入，目的、能量、行动力及一切坚强思想便随之消亡。
行动的意志源于我们“能够”做到的信念。疑虑与恐惧是知识的最大敌人，鼓励它们、不铲除它们的人，每一步都在自我阻碍。
征服了疑虑与恐惧者，即征服了失败。他的每一思想皆与力量结盟，所有困难皆

THE THOUGHT-FACTOR
IN ACHIEVEMENT
All that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts. In a justly ordered universe, where loss of equipoise would mean total destruction, individual responsibility must be absolute. A man's weakness and strength, purity and impurity, are his own, and not another man's; they are brought about by himself, and not by another; and they can only be altered by himself, never by another. His condition is also his own, and not another man's. His suffering and his happiness are evolved from within. As he thinks, so he is; as he continues to think, so he remains.
A strong man cannot help a weaker unless that weaker is ~willing~ to be helped, and even then the weak man must become strong of himself; he must, by his own efforts, develop the strength which he admires in another. None but himself can alter his condition.
It has been usual for men to think and to say, "Many men are slaves because one is an oppressor; let us hate the oppressor." Now, however, there is amongst an increasing few a tendency to reverse this judgment, and to say, "One man is an oppressor because many are slaves; let us despise the slaves."
The truth is that oppressor and slave are co-operators in ignorance, and, while seeming to afflict each other, are in reality afflicting themselves. A perfect Knowledge perceives the action of law in the weakness of the oppressed and the misapplied power of the oppressor; a perfect Love, seeing the suffering, which both states entail,

> 思想因素
在成就中的作用
一个人所取得的一切成就，以及他未能实现的一切，都是其自身思想的直接结果。在一个秩序井然的宇宙中，若失去平衡就意味着彻底毁灭，那么个人责任必须绝对化。一个人的软弱与坚强、纯洁与污浊，都是他自己的，而非他人；它们是由他自己造成的，而非他人；也唯有他自己才能改变它们，绝非他人所能改变。他的处境也是他自己的，而非他人。他的痛苦与幸福皆源于内心。他如何思考，便如何存在；他持续如何思考，便如何保持现状。
一个强者无法帮助一个较弱者，除非那个较弱者愿意接受帮助；即便如此，弱者也必须靠自己变得坚强；他必须通过自己的努力，发展出他所钦佩的他人所具有的力量。唯有他自己能改变自己的处境。
人们过去常这样思考并说：“许多人沦为奴隶，是因为有一个压迫者；让我们憎恨压迫者。” 然而，如今在越来越多的人中，却出现了一种倾向，即逆转这种判断，并说：“一个人成为压迫者，是因为许多人沦为奴隶；让我们鄙视这些奴隶。”
事实上，压迫者与奴隶是共同陷入无知的合作者，虽然表面上彼此伤害，实际上却是在伤害自己。真正的知识能洞察法律作用于被压迫者之软弱以及压迫者之滥用权力；真正的爱，看到这两种状态所导致的痛苦，

<!-- Paragraph 25 -->
condemns neither; a perfect Compassion embraces both oppressor and oppressed.
He who has conquered weakness, and has put away all selfish thoughts, belongs neither to oppressor nor oppressed. He is free.
A man can only rise, conquer, and achieve by lifting up his thoughts. He can only remain weak, and object, and miserable by refusing to lift up his thoughts.
Before a man can achieve anything, even in worldly things, he must lift his thoughts above slavish animal indulgence. He may not, in order to succeed, give up all animality and selfishness, by any means; but a portion of it must, at least, be sacrificed. A man whose first thought is bestial indulgence could neither think clearly nor plan methodically; he could not find and develop his latent resources, and would fail in any undertaking. Not having commenced to manfully control his thoughts, he is not in a position to control affairs and to adopt serious responsibilities. He is not fit to act independently and stand alone. But he is limited only by the thoughts, which he chooses.
There can be no progress, no achievement without sacrifice, and a man's worldly success will be in the measure that he sacrifices his confused animal thoughts, and fixes his mind on the development of his plans, and the strengthening of his resolution and self-reliance. And the higher he lifts his thoughts, the more manly, upright, and righteous he becomes, the greater will be his success, the more blessed and enduring will be his achievements.
The universe does not favour the greedy, the dishonest, the vicious, although on the mere surface it may sometimes appear to do so; it helps the honest, the magnanimous, the virtuous. All the great Teachers of the ages have declared this in varying forms, and to prove and know it a man has but to persist in making himself more

> 不谴责任何一方；一种完美的慈悲包容了压迫者与被压迫者。
征服了软弱、摒弃了所有自私念头的人，既不属于压迫者，也不属于被压迫者。他才是自由的。
一个人唯有提升自己的思想，才能崛起、征服并取得成就；他若拒绝提升思想，则只能保持软弱、抱怨并陷入不幸。
在一个人能取得任何成就——即使是在世俗事务中——之前，他必须将思想提升到超越奴性动物享乐的境界。他绝不能为了成功，以任何手段完全放弃动物性与自私性；但至少必须牺牲其中一部分。一个最初念头便是野蛮享乐的人，既无法清晰思考，也无法系统规划；他无法发掘并发展自己潜在的能力，任何事业都将失败。由于他尚未勇敢地掌控自己的思想，他也就无法掌控事务并承担严肃的责任。他不适合独立行动，无法独自站立。但他所受的限制，仅在于他自己所选择的思想。
没有牺牲，就不可能有进步，也不可能有成就；一个人在世俗中的成功程度，取决于他牺牲了多少混乱的动物性思想，将心思专注于计划的发展、意志的强化与自立精神的培养。他思想提升得越高，就越显得刚毅、正直、正义，他的成功也就越大，他的成就也将越幸福、越持久。
宇宙并不偏爱贪婪者、不诚实者或邪恶者，尽管表面上有时似乎如此；它帮助诚实者、宽宏大量者和有德行者。历代所有伟大的导师都以不同形式宣告过这一点，而要证实并认识它，一个人只需坚持不懈地使自己变得更加

<!-- Paragraph 26 -->
and more virtuous by lifting up his thoughts.
Intellectual achievements are the result of thought consecrated to the search for knowledge, or for the beautiful and true in life and nature. Such achievements may be sometimes connected with vanity and ambition, but they are not the outcome of those characteristics; they are the natural outgrowth of long and arduous effort, and of pure and unselfish thoughts.
Spiritual achievements are the consummation of holy aspirations. He who lives constantly in the conception of noble and lofty thoughts, who dwells upon all that is pure and unselfish, will, as surely as the sun reaches its zenith and the moon its full, become wise and noble in character, and rise into a position of influence and blessedness.
Achievement, of whatever kind, is the crown of effort, the diadem of thought. By the aid of self-control, resolution, purity, righteousness, and well-directed thought a man ascends; by the aid of animality, indolence, impurity, corruption, and confusion of thought a man descends.
A man may rise to high success in the world, and even to lofty altitudes in the spiritual realm, and again descend into weakness and wretchedness by allowing arrogant, selfish, and corrupt thoughts to take possession of him.
Victories attained by right thought can only be maintained by watchfulness. Many give way when success is assured, and rapidly fall back into failure.
All achievements, whether in the business, intellectual, or spiritual world, are the result of definitely directed thought, are governed by the same law and are of the same method; the only difference lies in ~the object of attainment.~

> 并使思想升华，从而更加高尚。
智力成就源于献身于追求知识、或生命与自然之美好与真理的思想。此类成就有时可能与虚荣和野心相连，但并非由这些特质所导致；它们是长期艰苦努力与纯粹无私思想的自然产物。
精神成就乃神圣志向的圆满。凡常怀崇高思想、沉思一切纯净无私之物者，必如太阳升至中天、月亮圆满之时，其品格必臻智慧与高贵，其地位亦必上升至影响力与福乐之境。
无论何种成就，皆为努力之冠冕，思想之桂冠。凭借自制、决心、纯洁、正直与专注之思想，人可上升；而凭借动物性、懒惰、污秽、腐败与思想混乱，人则必下降。
人或可于世间获得崇高成功，或在精神领域升至崇高境界，但若任傲慢、自私与腐败之思想占据其心，终将再度跌入软弱与悲惨之中。
由正直思想所赢得的胜利，唯有靠警觉方能维持。许多人一旦成功在望，便迅速退步，重归失败。
无论商业、智力或精神领域的成就，皆源于明确导向之思想，受同一法则支配，采用同一方法；唯一之别，仅在于所追求之目标。

VISIONS AND IDEALS
The dreamers are the saviours of the world. As the visible world is sustained by the invisible, so men, through all their trials and sins and sordid vocations, are nourished by the beautiful visions of their solitary dreamers. Humanity cannot forget its dreamers; it cannot let their ideals fade and die; it lives in them; it knows them as they ~realities~ which it shall one day see and know.
Composer, sculptor, painter, poet, prophet, sage, these are the makers of the after~world, the architects of heaven. The world is beautiful because they have lived; without them, labouring humanity would perish.
He who cherishes a beautiful vision, a lofty ideal in his heart, will one day realize it. Columbus cherished a vision of another world, and he discovered it; Copernicus fostered the vision of a multiplicity of worlds and a wider universe, and he revealed it; Buddha beheld the vision of a spiritual world of stainless beauty and perfect peace, and he entered into it.
Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all, heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built.
To desire is to obtain; to aspire is to, achieve. Shall man's basest desires receive the fullest measure of gratification, and his purest aspirations starve for lack of sustenance? Such is not the Law: such a condition of things can never obtain: "ask and receive."

> VISIONS AND IDEALS
梦想家是世界的救世主。正如可见的世界依赖于无形之物而得以维系，人类在经历所有苦难、罪孽与卑微职业的过程中，也因那些孤独梦想家所描绘的美丽愿景而获得滋养。人类绝不能忘记这些梦想家；绝不能让他们的理想褪色消亡；人类生活在他们之中，将他们视为自己终将亲眼目睹并真正理解的现实。
作曲家、雕塑家、画家、诗人、先知、智者，这些是后世世界的缔造者，天堂的建筑师。世界之所以美丽，是因为他们曾生活于此；若无他们，辛勤劳作的人类将走向毁灭。
凡心中珍藏美丽愿景、崇高理想的，终有一天会实现它。哥伦布心中怀揣着另一个世界的愿景，最终他发现了它；哥白尼培育了多重世界与更广阔宇宙的愿景，最终他揭示了它；佛陀目睹了无瑕之美与完美宁静的精神世界的愿景，最终他进入了它。
珍视你们的愿景；珍视你们的理想；珍视心中激荡的音乐，头脑中凝结的美，最纯净思想上披覆的温柔，因为从这些中将生长出所有欢愉的境况，所有天堂般的环境；只要你们忠于它们，你们的世界终将建成。
渴望即获得；追求即成就。难道人类最卑微的欲望能获得最圆满的满足，而最纯净的向往却因缺乏滋养而枯竭？这并非定律；如此境况绝不可能存在：“凡祈求的，就必得着。”

The greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream. The oak sleeps in the acorn; the bird waits in the egg; and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of realities.
Your circumstances may be uncongenial, but they shall not long remain so if you but perceive an Ideal and strive to reach it. You cannot travel ~within~ and stand still ~without.~ Here is a youth hard pressed by poverty and labour; confined long hours in an unhealthy workshop; unschooled, and lacking all the arts of refinement. But he dreams of better things; he thinks of intelligence, of refinement, of grace and beauty. He conceives of, mentally builds up, an ideal condition of life; the vision of a wider liberty and a larger scope takes possession of him; unrest urges him to action, and he utilizes all his spare time and means, small though they are, to the development of his latent powers and resources. Very soon so altered has his mind become that the workshop can no longer hold him. It has become so out of harmony with his mentality that it falls out of his life as a garment is cast aside, and, with the growth of opportunities, which fit the scope of his expanding powers, he passes out of it forever. Years later we see this youth as a full-grown man. We find him a master of certain forces of the mind, which he wields with worldwide influence and almost unequalled power. In his hands he holds the cords of gigantic responsibilities; he speaks, and lo, lives are changed; men and women hang upon his words and remould their characters, and, sunlike, he becomes the fixed and luminous centre round which innumerable destinies revolve. He has realized the Vision of his youth. He has become one with his Ideal.
And you, too, youthful reader, will realize the Vision (not the idle

> 怀抱崇高的梦想，当你做梦时，你便将成为那样的人。你的愿景是你未来必将成就的承诺；你的理想是你最终将揭示的预言。
最伟大的成就起初曾是一场梦想，一段时间内仍只是梦想。橡树蕴藏在橡果之中；鸟儿蛰伏于蛋壳之内；而在灵魂最高远的愿景中，一个觉醒的天使正在苏醒。梦想是现实的幼苗。
你的处境或许并不理想，但只要你能感知到一个理想并努力去实现它，这种处境就不会长久持续。你无法在内里停滞不前，同时在外在世界中不断前行。这里有一位青年，正被贫穷与劳作所压迫；他长时间被困在不健康的作坊中；未受教育，也缺乏一切优雅的技艺。但他梦想着更好的事物；他思考智慧、精致、优雅与美。他构想并精神上构建出理想的生活状态；对更广阔自由与更大发展空间的愿景占据了他的心灵；不安促使他付诸行动，他利用一切闲暇时间与微薄资源，发展自己潜藏的能力与资源。很快，他的思想便发生了巨大转变，以至于作坊再也无法容纳他。它已与他的精神格格不入，如同脱下旧衣一般被他抛弃；随着机会的增长，这些机会契合他不断扩展的能力范围，他便永远离开了那个环境。多年后，我们看到这位青年已成长为一个成熟的男人。我们发现他掌握了某些心智力量，这些力量被他以全球性影响和几乎无与伦比的力量加以运用。在他的手中，他握着巨大责任的缰绳；他开口，生命便随之改变；男女皆依附于他的言语，重塑自己的性格，如同太阳般，他成为无数命运围绕旋转的固定而明亮的中心。他实现了青年时代的愿景。他与自己的理想合而为一。
而你，年轻的读者，也将实现你的愿景（而非空虚的）

<!-- Paragraph 30 -->
wish) of your heart, be it base or beautiful, or a mixture of both,
for you will always gravitate toward that which you, secretly, most
love. Into your hands will be placed the exact results of your own
thoughts; you will receive that which you earn; no more, no less.
Whatever your present environment may be, you will fall, remain, or
rise with your thoughts, your Vision, your Ideal. You will become as
small as your controlling desire; as great as your dominant
aspiration: in the beautiful words of Stanton Kirkham Davis, "You
may be keeping accounts, and presently you shall walk out of the
door that for so long has seemed to you the barrier of your ideals,
and shall find yourself before an audience--the pen still behind
your ear, the ink stains on your fingers and then and there shall
pour out the torrent of your inspiration. You may be driving sheep,
and you shall wander to the city-bucolic and open-mouthed; shall
wander under the intrepid guidance of the spirit into the studio of
the master, and after a time he shall say, 'I have nothing more to
teach you.' And now you have become the master, who did so recently
dream of great things while driving sheep. You shall lay down the
saw and the plane to take upon yourself the regeneration of the
world."
The thoughtless, the ignorant, and the indolent, seeing only the
apparent effects of things and not the things themselves, talk of
luck, of fortune, and chance. Seeing a man grow rich, they say, "How
lucky he is!" Observing another become intellectual, they exclaim,
"How highly favoured he is!" And noting the saintly character and
wide influence of another, they remark, "How chance aids him at
every turn!" They do not see the trials and failures and struggles
which these men have voluntarily encountered in order to gain their
experience; have no knowledge of the sacrifices they have made, of
the undaunted efforts they have put forth, of the faith they have
exercised, that they might overcome the apparently insurmountable,
and realize the Vision of their heart. They do not know the darkness
and the heartaches; they only see the light and joy, and call it
"luck". They do not see the long and arduous journey, but only

> 你心中所愿，无论卑微或崇高，或两者兼而有之，
你终将不自觉地趋向于你最深爱之物。
你手中将握有你自身思想的精确结果；
你将获得你所应得之物；不多，不少。
无论你当前所处之环境如何，
你都将随你的思想、你的愿景、你的理想而沉落、停留或上升。
你将因主导欲望而变得渺小，
因主导志向而变得伟大：
正如斯坦顿·柯克汉姆·戴维斯所言：“你或许正记账，不久你便会走出那扇曾让你觉得是理想之屏障的大门，
发现自己站在观众面前——笔仍夹在耳后，手指沾满墨迹，
此时此刻，你的灵感之洪流将倾泻而出。
你或许正赶羊，
却将漫游至城市田园般的开阔之地，张口结舌；
将在精神的无畏引导下，步入大师的工作室，
过些时日，大师将说：“我已无更多可教你之物。”
而今，你已化身为曾赶羊时梦想伟大之事的大师。
你将放下锯子与刨子，肩负起再造世界之重任。”

那些无思之人、无知之人、懒惰之人，
只见事物之表象效果，而非事物本身，
便谈论运气、命运与偶然。
见一人为富，便说：“他多么幸运！”
见另一人变得博学，便惊叹：“他多么受宠！”
见另一人品格圣洁、影响深远，
便评论：“他每一步都得缘相助！”
他们看不见这些人为获得经验而自愿经历的种种考验、失败与挣扎；
不知他们所付出的牺牲、所付出的无畏努力、所秉持的信念，
以克服看似不可逾越之障碍，实现心中之愿景。
他们不知黑暗与心碎；
他们只见光明与欢愉，称之为“运气”。
他们看不见漫长而艰辛的旅程，
只看见

<!-- Paragraph 31 -->
behold the pleasant goal, and call it "good fortune," do not
understand the process, but only perceive the result, and call it
chance.
In all human affairs there are ~efforts~, and there are ~results~,
and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result. Chance
is not. Gifts, powers, material, intellectual, and spiritual
possessions are the fruits of effort; they are thoughts completed,
objects accomplished, visions realized.
The Vision that you glorify in your mind, the Ideal that you
enthrone in your heart~~this you will build your life by, this you
will become.

> 看啊，那美好的目标，称之为“好运”，却不理解过程，只感知结果，称之为“偶然”。
在所有人类事务中，有~努力~，也有~结果~，努力的强度正是结果的尺度。偶然并非如此。
天赋、能力、物质、智力与精神的财富，都是努力的果实；它们是完成的思想、实现的事业、达成的愿景。
你心中所崇敬的愿景，你心中所尊奉的理想——你将以此构建你的生命，你将由此成为你自己。

<!-- Paragraph 32 -->
SERENITY
Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.
A man becomes calm in the measure that he understands himself as a thought evolved being, for such knowledge necessitates the understanding of others as the result of thought, and as he develops a right understanding, and sees more and more clearly the internal relations of things by the action of cause and effect he ceases to fuss and fume and worry and grieve, and remains poised, steadfast, serene.
The calm man, having learned how to govern himself, knows how to adapt himself to others; and they, in turn, reverence his spiritual strength, and feel that they can learn of him and rely upon him. The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. Even the ordinary trader will find his business prosperity increase as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity, for people will always prefer to deal with a man whose demeanour is strongly equable.
The strong, calm man is always loved and revered. He is like a shade-giving tree in a thirsty land, or a sheltering rock in a storm. "Who does not love a tranquil heart, a sweet-tempered, balanced life? It does not matter whether it rains or shines, or what changes come to those possessing these blessings, for they are always sweet, serene, and calm. That exquisite poise of character, which we call serenity is the last lesson of culture, the fruitage of the soul. It is precious as wisdom, more to be desired

> 宁静
心灵的平静是智慧的美丽珍宝之一。它是自我控制长期耐心努力的结果。它的存在表明经验已臻成熟，对思想的规律与运作有着超越寻常的了解。
一个人在理解自己为一个由思想演化而成的存在时，便会变得平静，因为这种知识必然要求他理解他人也是思想的产物。随着他逐渐获得正确的理解，越来越清晰地看到事物内部因因果关系而产生的关联，他便不再焦躁、恼怒、忧虑或悲伤，而能保持镇定、坚定、宁静。
一个平静的人，既然学会了如何掌控自己，便也懂得如何适应他人；而他人也会因敬重他的精神力量，感到可以从他那里学习并信赖他。一个人越趋于宁静，他的成功、影响力和行善的能力就越大。即便是普通的商人，也会发现，当他培养出更强的自我控制和内心的平衡时，他的生意繁荣程度也会随之增加，因为人们总是更愿意与那些举止沉稳、情绪平和的人打交道。
坚强而平静的人总是受人爱戴和尊敬。他就像在干旱之地提供阴凉的树木，或在风暴中提供庇护的岩石。“谁不爱一颗宁静的心、一个温和而平衡的生活？无论下雨还是晴天，或那些拥有这些福分的人经历何种变化，这些福分始终甜美、宁静、平和。我们称之为‘宁静’的那一种卓越的品格平衡，是文化修养的最后课程，是灵魂的果实。它珍贵如智慧，更值得追求。”

than gold--yea, than even fine gold. How insignificant mere money
seeking looks in comparison with a serene life--a life that dwells
in the ocean of Truth, beneath the waves, beyond the reach of
tempests, in the Eternal Calm!
"How many people we know who sour their lives, who ruin all that is
sweet and beautiful by explosive tempers, who destroy their poise of
character, and make bad blood! It is a question whether the great
majority of people do not ruin their lives and mar their happiness
by lack of self-control. How few people we meet in life who are well
balanced, who have that exquisite poise which is characteristic of
the finished character!
Yes, humanity surges with uncontrolled passion, is tumultuous with
ungoverned grief, is blown about by anxiety and doubt only the wise
man, only he whose thoughts are controlled and purified, makes the
winds and the storms of the soul obey him.
Tempest-tossed souls, wherever ye may be, under whatsoever
conditions ye may live, know this in the ocean of life the isles of
Blessedness are smiling, and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits
your coming. Keep your hand firmly upon the helm of thought. In the
bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master; He does but sleep:
wake Him. Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery;
Calmness is power. Say unto your heart, "Peace, be still!"

> 比黄金更珍贵——甚至比精美的黄金更珍贵。与宁静的生活相比，仅仅追求金钱是多么微不足道——那是一种栖息于真理之海、潜于波浪之下、远离风暴、处于永恒宁静中的生活！
> 我们认识多少人，他们以暴躁的脾气毁掉了自己的生活，用激烈的性情破坏了所有甜美美好的事物，摧毁了自己的性格平衡，制造了仇恨！是否大多数人都因缺乏自制力而毁掉了自己的生活，破坏了自己的幸福？我们一生中遇到的真正平衡、拥有完美性格所特有的精致从容的人又有多少呢？
> 是的，人类被不受控制的激情所激荡，被无法驾驭的悲伤所困扰，被焦虑与疑虑所吹拂——唯有智者，唯有那些思想受控并被净化的人，才能使灵魂中的风与风暴听从他的指挥。
> 在风暴中颠簸的灵魂们，无论你们身处何地，无论你们生活于何种境况，请记住：在生命的海洋中，幸福之岛正微笑迎候，你们理想中的阳光海岸正等待你们的到来。请牢牢握住思想之舵。在你们灵魂之舟上，那位统御者正安卧着；他只是在沉睡——唤醒他吧！自制力即是力量；正念即是掌控；宁静即是力量。对你们的心说：“平安，静止吧！”
